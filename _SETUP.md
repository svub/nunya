### Usage Guidelines <a id="usage"></a> 

Help judges and other developers understand the project.

See the [DEMO_AND_VIDEO](./_DEMO_AND_VIDEO.md) file for details.

* **IMPORTANT**: Private secret contract on Secret Network must be deployed before deploying EVM gateway contract since it must be modified to include its address `routing_info` and code hash `routing_code_hash`.

* **NOTE**: The public key of the user that deploys the custom Nunya.Business contract is sent through to the custom EVM Gateway contract so only that user may call that custom EVM Gateway contract, however we actually want to try and use the default EVM Gateway contract that has been deployed by the Secret network team with minimal changes and move the logic to the Secret contract instead. Apart from the creator of the Nunya.Business contract, the only other users that call any Secret network functions are accounts whose public keys are provided by the creator of the Nunya.Business giving those accounts permission to call the withdraw function.

### Setup Frontend and Solidity Contracts <a id="setup-frontend"></a> 

#### Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Quickstart

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

2. Configure environment variables

* Hardhat

Copy the example and add the relevant keys from https://etherscan.io/ and https://account.getblock.io and https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps.

Note that Alchemy does not support Ethereum Sepolia, so use [Geoblocks](https://getblock.io/) instead to get an API key for Ethereum Sepolia JSON-RPC.
```bash
cp ./packages/hardhat/.env.example ./packages/hardhat/.env
```
Verify the contents of ./packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts

Update Gateway.sol to change the value of `secret_gateway_signer_address` to be the deployed Gateway address on the Mainnet or Testnet of the Secret Network.

* Nextjs

Use the same Alchemy API key. Obtain a WalletConnect project ID at https://cloud.walletconnect.com
```bash
cp ./packages/nextjs/.env.example ./packages/nextjs/.env
```
Verify the contents of ./packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts

3. Setup network

* **Local Network** (on remote machine)

* Connect to Linode (e.g. in the example shown below the Linode server IP address is 172.105.188.31)
```
ssh root@172.105.188.31
```

If you want to run a local network:

Note: Use `accounts: [deployerPrivateKey]` or `accounts: { mnemonic: MNEMONIC }` in ./packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts and specify the IP Address where it is being run.

* Terminal 1
```
yarn hardhat:chain
```

Example output:
```
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://172.105.188.31:8545/

Accounts
========
...
```

* Compile and Deploy to Local Network
```
yarn hardhat:clean
yarn hardhat:compile
yarn hardhat:deploy --network localhost
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

* **Testnet**

Check configured correctly.

```
yarn hardhat:clean
yarn hardhat:compile
yarn hardhat:deploy --network sepolia
```

> Note: The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn hardhat:deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

Note: If it has deployed previously it will output `Nothing to compile. No need to generate any newer typings.`. To make a fresh deployment first run `yarn run hardhat:clean` from the project root folder.

Example of output:
```
Generating typings for: 9 artifacts in dir: typechain-types for target: ethers-v6
Successfully generated 20 typings!
Compiled 9 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).

```

> Warning: Do not rename 01_deploy_your_contract.ts to 00_deploy_your_contract.ts or it will only compile but will not deploy
4. Add the deployed Nunya.business Contract Address to `nunyaBusinessContractAddress` and Gateway address `gatewayContractAddress` for the relevant network in ./nunya/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/config/deploy.ts

5. Call the Nunya.business Contract `setEVMGatewayAddress` function to set the Gateway EVM address in its state.

* Run script:
```bash
yarn run secret:setEVMGatewayAddress
```

Example transaction hash: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xef7a241e3eba870138323440e910e2a0e608654a46bd7720af8e03ed63618f3a

6. View the contract in block explorer

Example previous deployment: 
  NunyaBusiness: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xAFFF311821C3F3AF863C7103BB17BDC1Ba04603D#code

  Gateway: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1E4B12A9F82b33DA1127B27861EFf5E652de7a6F#code

7. Interact with deployed EVM Gateway via the NunyaBusiness contract

Assumes that you have already uploaded and instantiated the custom Secret contract in the [Setup Secret Contracts](#setup-secret) section.

Skip to the [`requestValue`](#requestValue) step in the [Setup Secret Contracts](#setup-secret) section.

8. On a third terminal, start the Nunya NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit smart contracts such as `NunyaBusiness.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

Deploy Relayer of SecretPath on Localhost

###### Deploy Gateway of SecretPath on Localhost

* Note: An example of the Gateway to be deployed on Secret Network is here https://github.com/SecretSaturn/SecretPath/tree/main/TNLS-Gateways/secret. This example was used to create github/svub/nunya/packages/secret-contracts/secret-gateway

* Connect to Linode
```
ssh root@172.105.188.31
```

* Clone the Github repo containing the Secret Gateway and initialise the submodules
```
mkdir -p github/ltfschoen && cd github/ltfschoen
git clone https://github.com/svub/nunya
cd nunya
git fetch origin submit-pubkey:submit-pubkey
git checkout submit-pubkey
cd packages/secret-contracts/secret-gateway
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* Terminal Tab 1: Secret Localhost (Localsecret)
  ```
  make start-server
  ```

* Terminal Tab 2: [Compile](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/readme-1/compile-and-deploy#compile-the-code). Note: Outputs contract.wasm or contract.wasm.gz file in the root directory being the ./SecretPath/TNLS-Gateways/secret/ folder. Using `make build-mainnet-reproducible` will remove contract.wasm so only the optimised contract.wasm.gz remains. Warning: If you only run `make build-mainnet` then you will get this error https://github.com/svub/nunya/issues/8 when deploying.

  * Secret Gateway Contract
    ```
    make clean
    make build
    ```
    * Note: If `wasm-opt` binary is required but not installed on macOS install it with `brew install binaryen`
    * Note: Use `make build-mainnet-reproducible` to deploy to Testnet
    * Note: The default Makefile originally used `--features="debug-print"` but running that gives error `the package secret_gateway depends on secret-cosmwasm-std, with features: debug-print but secret-cosmwasm-std does not have these features.`. The reason why it was removed is mentioned here:
        * https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1841
          * https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/pull/453
        * https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1667
        * https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1953
      * Solution:
        * https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/contracts/cyberpunk/tests/integration.rs#L126
      * TODO: For Production on mainnet, configure it to use a debug-print or debug_print with a custom feature flag and wrap use of `set_debug_handler` with it so debug logs aren't output in production.

* Note: Use existing secretdev Docker container that is running already.

* Copy compiled Secret Gateway contract to the Docker container
  ```
  make copy-secret-gateway-contract-local
  ```

* Store compiled Secret Gateway contract on Localhost (Localsecret network)
  ```
  make store-secret-gateway-contract-local
  ```
  * Note: To enter the Docker container to interact manually with secretcli:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it secretdev /bin/bash
    secretcli --help
    secretcli keys list
    ls /root/.secretd/config
    ```

  * Example output:
    ```
    {"height":"0","txhash":"A5A2E9864A3F455AD503935AE739B4E898F71A5B5BFCDB7B7D6934942297223C","codespace":"","code":0,"data":"","raw_log":"","logs":[],"info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","tx":null,"timestamp":"","events":[]}
    ```
  * Note that in the Secret Localsecret chain logs it output:
    ```
    11:43AM INF finalizing commit of block hash=9B39F1E7367B876F61E45CFD0DE3EC55CE59D140A4604E35622D8C6CDEE1BB66 height=115 module=consensus num_txs=1 root=371919C2BE93B7F0C2B81837770B871592793F8A74847C04593F27F8A62109A1
    ```
    * TODO: Why didn't it output `"height":"115"` instead of `"height":"0"`?

  ```

  * Generate an Ethereum wallet with address, private key, mnemonic phrase, and encrypted JSON file using MyCrypto desktop from Github https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/releases/tag/1.7.17 and ensure that you verify the checksum of the download. Import that into Keplar browser extension using the **private key** to obtain the associated Secret Network address. Verify that the Ethereum address on the Ethereum Network in the Keplar wallet once imported matches the Ethereum address that was chosen.

  * Add for Localhost of Ethereum the private key into `ethereum-private-key = XXXXX` of the .env file /Users/luke/code/clones/github/svub/nunya/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/.env

  TODO - why doesn't the wallet address recovered with `custom_mnemonic` match the one that was generated with MyCrypto when recovering it with that mnemonic phrase? is it possible to recover with the private key instead so it recovers the correct wallet address?

  Note: Used `m/44'/60'/0'/0` since that was the default HD path chosen when generating the wallet in MyCrypto for use with Metamask that uses BIP44 derivation, where the HD path is defined as `m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`

#### Configure

##### Deploy Nunya Contract on Localhost

* Open file ./nunya/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/config/deploy.ts
* Check ./nunya/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/.env has been created from the .env-sample file

* Reference: https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/example-contracts/tools-and-libraries/local-secret#advantages-of-localsecret-vs.-a-public-testnet

###### Testnet

* Edit config.secret.network to be "testnet"

###### Localhost

* Edit config.secret.network to be "localhost"
  * Ensure `ENDPOINT_LOCAL` is set to where you are running the Secret Localhost (e.g. `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:1317`)
  * Ensure that `gatewayAddress`, `gatewayHash`, `gatewayPublicKey`, and `gatewayEncryptionKeyForChaChaPoly1305` and set to where you deployed the Gateway on Localhost

#### Create, Compile and Deploy (Upload and Instantiate) Secret Contract

##### Create, Compile

* Note: To build on macOS it was necessary to run the following first as specified here https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/issues/283#issuecomment-1590391777. Other details https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/1824

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install llvm
llvm-config --version
echo "export AR=$(which llvm-ar)" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export CC=$(which clang)" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
``` 

* Run Docker (e.g. Docker Desktop on macOS)

* Remove any old Docker containers
```
docker rmi sco
```

* [Compile](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/readme-1/compile-and-deploy#compile-the-code). Note: Outputs contract.wasm and contract.wasm.gz file in the root directory of the secret-contracts/nunya-contract folder. Using `make build-mainnet-reproducible` will remove contract.wasm so only the optimised contract.wasm.gz remains. Warning: If you only run `make build-mainnet` then you will get this error https://github.com/svub/nunya/issues/8 when deploying.

###### Testnet

  * Nunya Contract
    ```
    cd packages/secret-contracts/nunya-contract
    make clean
    make build-mainnet-reproducible
    ```

  OR

  * My Counter Contract (Example only)
    ```
    cd packages/secret-contracts/my-counter-contract
    make clean
    make build-mainnet-reproducible
    ```

###### Localhost

  * Nunya Contract
    ```
    cd packages/secret-contracts/nunya-contract
    make clean
    make build
    ```

##### Deploy (Upload and Instantiate)

###### Testnet

* Upload and Instantiate 

> IMPORTANT: Prior to Upload step it is necessary to recompile changes if any.

> IMPORTANT: Prior to Upload step it is necessary to configure the wallet, network, and endpoint to use either Local or Testnet, and to specify what project's compiled smart contract WASM file to use and whether to use the optimized build (e.g. ./nunya-contract/optimized-wasm/secret_evm_storage.wasm.gz or ./nunya-contract/contract.wasm.gz) in the script ./packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/index.ts

> IMPORTANT: Prior to Instantiation step it is necessary to deploy the EVM Gateway

* Update the secretjs dependency in ./packages/secret-contracts-scripts/package.json to use a version from https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js/tags that works (e.g. 1.15.0-beta.1) by asking the Secret Network team.
Use 1.15.0-beta.1.
Note that 1.15.0-beta.2 may only upload but does not instantiate.
Note that 1.15.0-beta.0 does not upload at all.

> IMPORTANT: Errors deploying may be because of mismatched types, for example InstantiateMsg here https://github.com/svub/nunya/blob/45e884194e8183229e3d7c61ccba7d789ff996b1/packages/secret-contracts/nunya-contract/src/msg.rs#L16C12-L16C26 must match here https://github.com/svub/nunya/blob/45e884194e8183229e3d7c61ccba7d789ff996b1/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/instantiate.ts#L92

> IMPORTANT: Both upload and instantiate must be performed using the same version of secretjs

```
yarn install
cd ../../../
yarn run secret:clean
yarn run secret:upload
```

* Add the `CODE_ID` to `codeId` and `CODE_HASH` to `contractCodeHash` respectively to the relevant config.secret.<network> in ./packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/config/deploy.ts
* Add the terminal log to ./logs/uploadOutput.log

> IMPORTANT: If deployment of the code with `await secretjs.tx.compute.storeCode` is unsuccessful, then check if Beta version of secretjs is necessary incase the Secret Testnet is being upgraded.

```
yarn run secret:instantiate
```

* Add the `SECRET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to `secretContractAddress` in the relevant config.secret.<network> in ./nunya/packages/secret-contracts-scripts/src/config/deploy.ts
* Add the terminal log to ./logs/instantiateOutput.log

* View logs at ./logs/instantiateOutput.log
* View on Secret Testnet block explorer at https://testnet.ping.pub/secret/

* Reference https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/readme-1/compile-and-deploy

###### Localhost

* Note: Only run `make start-server if necessary
```bash
make start-server
make copy-nunya-contract-local
make store-nunya-contract-local
```
