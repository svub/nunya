## About <a id="about"></a>

Wanna get yer salary in crypto, but don't want all your clients to know what you charge the others? Nunya.business can help! Your clients pay to a smart contract and you can decide when you pick up the treasure. All bookkeeping is done in a separate private smart contract on the [Secret.network](https://scrt.network/).

### User focused summary <a id="user-focused-summary"></a>

For newcomers to public ledgers, it can be a rude awakening to realize that sharing an address means anyone can track all of their transactionsâ€”both incoming and outgoing, past and future! Imagine this for your bank account ... unsettling, right? 

Nunya FTW! By adding a Nunya payment referenceâ€”via link or QR codeâ€”to your invoice, clients can pay directly from their Web3 wallets without exposing any sensitive details. Later onâ€”in parts or at onceâ€”redeem their payments to any address. Encryption ensures that all bookkeeping data is kept protected in a secret contract on [Secret.network](https://scrt.network/). Like a bank account, but decentralizedâ€”and better. ðŸ˜Ž

#### What is the problem it solves and the product market fit


Nunya addresses a key challenge in blockchain payments: balancing transparency with privacy. It offers a simple, user-friendly platform that lets businesses accept crypto payments without exposing transaction history or wallet balances.

Built on-chain with no central authority, Nunya combines the security and decentralization of blockchain with enhanced confidentiality. By integrating with public blockchains like Ethereum and other EVM chains, it brings the privacy typically found in traditional banking to decentralized finance (DeFi).

In the future, Nunya can incentivize community engagement with a utility token and generate revenue through services  fees, similar to DeFi protocols like Uniswap.

In short, Nunya bridges the gap between transparency and privacy, providing businesses with a secure, scalable, and professional way to manage crypto payments while preserving the privacy of all parties involved.
