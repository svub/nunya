# About

Wanna get yer salary in crypto, but don't want all your clients to know what you charge the others? Nunya.business can help! Your clients pay to a smart contract and you can decide when you pick up the treasure. All bookkeeping is done in a separate private smart contract on the [Secret.network](https://scrt.network/).

### The use case

For people new to public ledgers, it can be a rude awakening to realize that sharing an address means anyone can track all of their transactionsâ€”both incoming and outgoing, past and future! Imagine if every person you gave your bank account number to could access your entire transaction history... Unsettling, right? 

Nunya ftw! By adding a simple Nunya payment referenceâ€”either as a link or a QR codeâ€”to your invoice, you can enable clients to pay directly from their Web3 wallets without exposing any sensitive details. Later on, you can in parts or all at once redeem their payments to an address of your choosing. Encryption ensures that all bookkeeping data is kept protected in a secret contract on [Secret.network](https://scrt.network/). Like with a bank and a bank account. But decentralized and better. ðŸ˜Ž

### The pitch

In the world of blockchain payments, a critical challenge remains: balancing the inherent transparency of public ledgers with the privacy needs of businesses and individuals. **Nunya** solves this problem by providing a simple, user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to accept crypto payments without exposing their personal transaction history or wallet balances. 

Built on-chain with no central authority, Nunya leverages the security and decentralization of blockchain while maintaining confidentiality. By integrating with public ledger blockchains like Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, Nunya brings a level of privacy typically reserved for traditional banking systems to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Furthermore, Nunya offers a pathway to incentivize community engagement through a customizable utility token, and the platform can generate sustainable revenue by incorporating automated transaction feesâ€”similar to the mechanisms employed by DeFi protocols like Uniswap. 

In short, Nunya bridges the gap between transparency and privacy, providing businesses with a secure, scalable, and professional way to manage crypto payments while preserving the privacy of all parties involved.
